# The Fallout Save File Tool... Thing
Extremely early stage and developmental tool for viewing and potentially modifying fallout save files. The tool is currently only set up to understand save files from *Fallout: New Vegas*. Currently, if you place a save file in the root folder of this crate named "test.fos" and run the program it will print the save image dimentions and save the image as a PNG to the crate root with a name that is parsed from the save file. I built a lot of the file parser up to the point of the save file where the save image exists and then got very distracted playing with that section. This crate has a long way to go before it's anything and isn't really open to contribution. It's just something I might come back to and tinker on every now and then. But if you like some of the framework I've built and want to use it for your own projects you're more than welcome to fork this repo and use what you wish.
